    <h1> My Hobby </h1>
    <h2> Playing Basketball </h2>
            <p> I like to play basketball because it is fun and because I get to embarrass my brother in some way. I get to prove others a point without having to talk. The moves I can do are so cool, and I learn more stuff about basketball everyday. I also get vitaman D by staying which is good for every kid my age. Playing basketball is fun because I also get to learn life lessons. One time my friend said "I need to go now", and I need to go too. Thanks for stopping by to check out this website!</p>

         
               <h2> About Basketball </h2>
                <p>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball through the defender's hoop while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.</p> </section>
